# Facebook API Connectio

This is an Facebook api connection with a render option with Handlebars.
You can use another method for this if you like.

When u use this example, please bare in mind that the modules are combined with an Gulp task called [Browserify](). If you don't use Gulp, you can download my pipeline at [www.github.com/MartijnNieuwenhuizen/gulp-pipeline]()
